# 📸 ID Image Capture Guide for OCR

## Why Image Quality Matters

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) accuracy depends heavily on image quality. A poor quality image will result in:
- ❌ Low confidence scores (< 50%)
- ❌ Gibberish text extraction
- ❌ Failed field parsing
- ❌ Rejected KYC verification

A good quality image will give you:
- ✅ High confidence scores (70-95%)
- ✅ Accurate text extraction
- ✅ Successful field parsing
- ✅ Smooth KYC approval

## 📋 Quick Checklist

Before uploading an ID image, ensure:
- [ ] Image is **clear and sharp** (not blurry)
- [ ] Text is **readable** to the human eye
- [ ] **Good lighting** (no shadows or glare)
- [ ] ID is **flat** (not bent or curved)
- [ ] **High resolution** (at least 1000px wide)
- [ ] **Proper orientation** (right side up)
- [ ] **Full ID visible** (all corners in frame)
- [ ] **No fingers** covering any part

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Method 1: Scanner (BEST)

**Recommended for highest accuracy**

1. **Clean the scanner glass**
   - Remove dust and fingerprints
   - Use a microfiber cloth

2. **Place ID face down**
   - Align with scanner edges
   - Ensure it's flat

3. **Scanner settings:**
   - **Resolution:** 300 DPI minimum (600 DPI better)
   - **Color mode:** Color or Grayscale
   - **Format:** PNG (best) or high-quality JPG (90%+)
   - **File size:** 500KB - 5MB

4. **Scan both sides**
   - Front: Photo, name, ID number
   - Back: Address, signature

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Confidence: 85-95%
- ✅ Perfect text extraction
- ✅ All fields parsed correctly

---

### Method 2: Smartphone Camera (GOOD)

**Use when scanner not available**

#### Setup:
1. **Find good lighting**
   - Natural daylight (near window) is best
   - Bright LED light works too
   - Avoid direct sunlight (causes glare)
   - Avoid yellow/warm lights (use white light)

2. **Prepare surface**
   - Use a dark, non-reflective surface
   - Place ID flat on surface
   - No patterns or text underneath

3. **Camera position**
   - Hold phone directly above ID (not at angle)
   - Distance: 20-30cm (8-12 inches)
   - ID should fill 60-80% of frame
   - Keep phone parallel to ID

#### Camera Settings:
- **Focus:** Tap on ID to focus
- **Flash:** OFF (causes glare)
- **HDR:** OFF (can blur text)
- **Resolution:** Highest available
- **Zoom:** Don't use digital zoom (get closer instead)

#### Taking the Photo:
1. Hold phone steady (use both hands)
2. Take a deep breath
3. Tap shutter button gently
4. Take 2-3 photos (choose best one)
5. Review photo before uploading:
   - Zoom in to check text is sharp
   - All text is readable
   - No blur or motion

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Confidence: 70-85%
- ✅ Good text extraction
- ✅ Most fields parsed correctly

---

### Method 3: Webcam (ACCEPTABLE)

**Last resort option**

1. **Setup:**
   - Clean webcam lens
   - Use external webcam if possible (better quality)
   - Position ID on stand or prop it up
   - Distance: 15-20cm from webcam

2. **Lighting:**
   - Face a window (natural light)
   - Use desk lamp on both sides
   - Avoid backlighting

3. **Capture:**
   - Use highest resolution setting
   - Take multiple shots
   - Choose sharpest image

**Expected Result:**
- ⚠️ Confidence: 50-70%
- ⚠️ Moderate text extraction
- ⚠️ Some fields may fail

## ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **Blurry Images**
**Problem:** Camera moved during capture
**Solution:** 
- Hold phone steady with both hands
- Lean against wall for stability
- Use timer mode (2-3 second delay)
- Use tripod or phone stand

### 2. **Poor Lighting**
**Problem:** Dark shadows, yellow tint, glare
**Solution:**
- Use natural daylight
- Add more light sources
- Position lights at 45° angles
- Avoid direct overhead lights

### 3. **Glare/Reflections**
**Problem:** Shiny ID surface reflects light
**Solution:**
- Turn off flash
- Angle ID slightly (5-10°)
- Use diffused light (through curtain)
- Avoid direct light sources

### 4. **Low Resolution**
**Problem:** Image too small, pixelated
**Solution:**
- Use highest camera resolution
- Get closer to ID (don't zoom)
- Don't crop too much
- Save as PNG or high-quality JPG

### 5. **Wrong Angle**
**Problem:** ID appears distorted, text slanted
**Solution:**
- Hold phone directly above ID
- Keep phone parallel to ID
- Use grid lines to align
- Check edges are straight

### 6. **Partial ID**
**Problem:** Corners or edges cut off
**Solution:**
- Include full ID in frame
- Leave small margin around edges
- Check preview before capturing

### 7. **Dirty/Damaged ID**
**Problem:** Scratches, stains, worn text
**Solution:**
- Clean ID gently with soft cloth
- If text is worn, may need to reapply for new ID
- Capture in best possible condition
