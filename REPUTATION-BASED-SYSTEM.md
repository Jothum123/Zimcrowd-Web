# 💰 ZimScore Reputation-Based Loan System

## 🎯 **Core Concept**

**Everyone starts at $50. Build your reputation through on-time repayments to unlock higher loan limits.**

### **How It Works:**

1. **Reputation-Based Limits:** Your ZimScore determines your maximum loan amount ($50 to $1000)
2. **User-Selected Interest:** You choose your own interest rate (3-10% per month)
3. **Marketplace Model:** Lenders browse requests and fund loans they like
4. **Build Trust:** On-time repayments increase your score and unlock higher limits
